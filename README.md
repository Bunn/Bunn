Hi there! 

I'm Fernando Bunn. I started developing apps for phones as a hobby back in 2006 with the glorious J2ME. Since 2008, I have dedicated my career to iOS development. This journey began when Interface Builder was separated from Xcode, with those majestic floating windows, and iOS was known as iPhone OS.

Over the years, I have made significant contributions to various projects. I was involved in developing the first Salesforce [iPad app](https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/07/salesforce-takes-chatter-mobile-with-iphone-ipad-android-and-blackberry-apps/), creating apps like the initial version of the Maxim/Outside magazine for the iPad, and developing [StoryDesk](https://vimeo.com/109495626) from the ground up, a native presentation iPad app that was later acquired by Showpad. Additionally, I founded a mobile design and development [studio](https://www.nkey.com.br/). Subsequently, I launched and supported the MyTime Scheduler for Merchants app at [MyTime](https://mytime.com/) before joining [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com), where I am currently based.
